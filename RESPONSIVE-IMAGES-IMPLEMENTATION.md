## Responsive Image Strategy

### Viewport Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: ≤767px → `/optimized/mobile/` (400px width)
- **Tablet**: ≤991px → `/optimized/tablet/` (768px width)  
- **Desktop**: ≥992px → `/optimized/desktop/` (1200px width)

### Implementation Pattern
Each image uses HTML5 `<picture>` element with:
```html
<picture>
    <source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="assets/[path]/optimized/mobile/[image].webp" type="image/webp">
    <source media="(max-width: 991px)" srcset="assets/[path]/optimized/tablet/[image].webp" type="image/webp">
    <source media="(min-width: 992px)" srcset="assets/[path]/optimized/desktop/[image].webp" type="image/webp">
    <img src="assets/[path]/[image].webp" alt="[description]" loading="lazy">
</picture>
```

## Image Categories and Paths

### Service Carousels
- **BT (Balloon Twisting)**: `assets/img/BT/optimized/[viewport]/BT[1-6].webp`
- **BD (Balloon Characters)**: `assets/img/optimized/[viewport]/BD[1-5].webp`
- **BF (Balloon Flowers)**: `assets/img/BF/optimized/[viewport]/BF[1-6].webp`
